# ArrayFireNim

ArrayFireNim is a [Nim](http://www.nim-lang.org) wrapper for [Arrayfire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire).

It enables *very fast* Array operations on different backends (CPU, OpenCL, CUDA) 

Compilation requires the C++ backend of nim (compile with cpp option)

The wrapper is using the unified backend making it is possible to switch backends at runtime.

Currently this package is developed and tested on Arch Linux.

On Windows the package is not working, any support to get it working on Windows or other platforms is highly welcome!
